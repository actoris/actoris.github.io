Welcome to my personal site. Here you can find tech related musings and a list of my side projects. I graduated in 2017 from the [University of Connecticut](https://www.cse.uconn.edu/) with a degree in Computer Science, and am starting my career as a Software Engineer at [Zola](http://www.zola.com).
